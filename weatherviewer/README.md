# WeatherViewer (Lab)

### Getting Started

Run `flutter create weatherviewer` and open your project in VS Code.


### Overview

In this lab, you will be creating a simple Weather app using Flutter. Using skills covered during the presentation, your app should be able to:

- Fetch weather data from the internet
- Display weather across several cities
- Show the forecast for the next few days

This project is fairly open-ended, so feel free to design your app however you wish! Screenshots and code from a sample WeatherViewer are provided if you get stuck, or need to reference any components. If you have any questions, feel free to contact any of the TAs for help. 

Good luck, and have fun!


### Fetching Data

The data you will be using is sourced from the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api). However, instead of fiddling with API Keys and rate limits, a sample JSON file is available at https://akshathjain.com/FlutterWorkshop/json/weather_info.json. Treat that as your "API" for the purposes of this lab. Although, you're definitely more than welcome to try and use the real thing!

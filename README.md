# Flutter Workshop
## Crash Course 2019

Flutter is a cross-platform, mobile development framework created by Google. With user-centric design in mind, Flutter allows developers to create beautiful native apps on iOS and Android from a single codebase.


### Attending

No experience with Flutter, Dart, or mobile programming is necessary. And while not required, some experience with programming is recommended.


### Flutter Installation

Follow the instructions found on the flutter website to get started. When asked to setup your environment, choose VS Code (as opposed to Android Studio).
- [macOS](https://flutter.io/docs/get-started/install/macos)
- [Linux](https://flutter.io/docs/get-started/install/linux)
- [Windows](https://flutter.io/docs/get-started/install/windows)

Once the installation is complete, validate your setup by running `flutter doctor` in your terminal (Command Prompt / PowerShell on Windows) to ensure that everything is up and running.

Your output should look something like this:

```
[✓] Flutter (Channel beta, v1.0.0, on Mac OS X 10.14.2 18C54, locale en-US)
[✓] Android toolchain - develop for Android devices (Andr
[✓] iOS toolchain - develop for iOS devices (Xcode 10.1)
[✓] Android Studio (version 3.1)
[✓] VS Code (version 1.30.2)
[✓] Connected device (1 available)
```


### Installing an Emulator

Flutter allows you to install your applications directly onto physical hardware using `flutter run`. However, if you don't have a device that you can use, you can install an emulator relatively easily.

**Android**
- Install Android Studio
- 

**iOS (macOS only)**
- Install xCode
- Go to *Preferences -> Components* and choose the emulator you would like to install


### Running the Emulator

To run either the iOS or Android emulator, run `flutter emulators --launch <name of emulator>`.\
To list availabe emulators, run `flutter emulators`.\
Note that to install an Android emulator, you'll need to have Android
